# EV Charging Session Calculator

## App Intent

This [simple web app](https://ev-charging-calculator-cbc8.figma.site/) is intended to help people begin to visualize what a typical EV Charging session looks like. They can adjust parameters like charging speed, time spent charging, and cost to get an idea of how that affects their vehicle. They can adjust starting SoC and adjust Vehicle parameters if desrired (default is based on Hyundai IONIQ 5 SEL RWD).

## Next steps
- Create some helpful graphs and charts for better visualization.
- Add "relative timing" to help users get an idea of how long charging takes at the associated speed and what they may be doing (e.g. coffee with friends v.s. bathroom break on road trip)
- Provid simpler interface for an AI query.
  - I want to get from Savannah to Atlanta as quick as possible. (AI Thinks: What would my charging session look like given this prompt?)
  - At what charging speeds would I need to gain about 50 miles while sitting at a coffee shop for 30 minuets? (AI Thinks: What charging parameters do I need to gain ~50 miles in 30 minutes?)

## How I Built This

Developed this app with the help of Figma Make, starting with a design I drew and uploaded. This is a code bundle for EV Charging Session Calculator. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/community/file/1554775711231955459/ev-charging-session-calculator.

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
